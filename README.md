# Helix_alm
Basic Helix ALM startup kit

Run this file to run Helix ALM license server, ALM server and client application. Same can be used to turn off the servers or restart if required. 

In case the help option does not work, try downloading brave-browser into the linux machine or replace the relevent browser name in the source code. 

Once the servers are turned off, you will need to restart the program in order for the servers to get back online.
